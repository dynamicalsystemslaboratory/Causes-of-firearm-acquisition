guns_ent2.m
- matlab code to compute conditional entropies of binary multivariate time-series.

guns_boot.m
- matlab code to generate surrogate binary time-series following a local permutation scheme.

Study1.m
- matlab code to perform study 1 and reproduce data in Table 2. This code computes conditional transfer entropy on binary time-series, generates surrogate binary time-series following a local permutation scheme, and estimates p-values for conditional transfer entropy.

Study2.m
- matlab code to perform study 2 and reproduce data in Table 3. This code computes conditional transfer entropy on binary time-series, generates surrogate binary time-series following a local permutation scheme, and estimates p-values for conditional transfer entropy.

Study3.m
- matlab code to perform study 3 and reproduce data in Table 4. This code computes conditional transfer entropy on binary time-series, generates surrogate binary time-series following a local permutation scheme, and estimates p-values for conditional transfer entropy.
